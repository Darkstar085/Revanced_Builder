# ProVanced
ProVanced is unofficial continuation of Revanced Extended(by [inotia00](https://github.com/inotia00/ReVanced_Extended)) with some tweaks wherever needed. ProVanced is more focused on simplicity instead of cluttering too many features, just the basic necessities to improve the youtube experience.
